# Hey, I'm Andrew 👋, Nice to meet you!

I'm a 4th-year undergraduate at UCLA (Class of '26), majoring in Computer Science and Linguistics. I’m fascinated by the gap between human language and code, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Computational Linguistics**.

Right now, I'm at Illumio building technical documentation infrastructure. I help my team ship documentation faster and more reliably by automating how we build, deploy, and maintain our [technical documentation](https://docs.illumio.com/s).

I’m really interested in the potential of a decentralized web. It’s exciting to see how we can use these protocols to remove intermediaries and give people true ownership over their digital assets.

## Automation

I’m passionate about building automation systems that eliminate repetitive, error-prone workflows to save time.

A project I am proud of is **[Veil](https://github.com/aandrewduong/veil-cli)**. It automates the entire De Anza and Foothill College course enrollment process from start to finish using direct HTTP requests, eliminating the need for slow browser-based interaction.
